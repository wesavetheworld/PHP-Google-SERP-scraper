# PHP-Google-SERP-scraper
Scraper delle SERP di Google fatto in PHP

The majority of this script comes from this one made by kbeezie: http://kbeezie.com/scraping-google-results/
I think it was an abandoned project, so I updated it a little bit, allowing even multi-keyword scraping (by passing an array of keywords to the $keyword variable)
